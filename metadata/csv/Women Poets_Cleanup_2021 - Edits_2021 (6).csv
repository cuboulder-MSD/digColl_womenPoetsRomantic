Planché (tentatively dated 1800 in the BM Cat.),,"With a short preface by the translator, in English, in which he notes that he has made a few small alterations to the original work, suppressing that which relates only to England and replacing it with subjects relating to France. Mrs. Barbauld published the first part of her very popular Lessons for children in 1778 because she could find no book adapted to the comprehension of little children.

Particular difficulties in which young men are now exposed -- LETTER I. Submission and exertion required from youth – Advantages of maternal friendship, and confidential intercourse. Danger of romantic expectations, and false notions of independence -- LETTER II. Practical wisdom of our ancestors – National education, as it is adapted to various ranks. Legal restrictions on youth. Portrait of confidence and insignificance, as depicted in a dashing lad of spirit -- LETTER III. Miscellaneous remarks in vindication of the character of the past ages; commencing with those immediately succeeding the Reformation; tending to prove, that, allowing for a difference in refinement, they were not inferior in sound sense and morality to the present times. General remarks on the earlier periods of English history -- LETTER IV. Advantages of historical knowledge, in correcting the misrepresentations of democratic writers. Great benefits have been derived from customs and events which are often the subject of censure. Providence gradually brings good out of evil; and, from what is rude, forms what is perfect. -- LETTER V. The necessity of publicly uniting with somebody of Christians. Advantages of being early familiarized with the distinguishing doctrines of our religion. Circumstances which attended the foundation of the Church of England. Its general character. -- LETTER VI. The expediency of a rule of faith and form of worship considered. Our services vindicated from some objections. Errors in methodistical tenets, and extreme rigidity of manners. -- VOLUME II. : LETTER VII. Socinian opinions which lead to Deism considered. The historical books of Moses vindicated, by circumstances drawn from natural history and profane authors. Several objections to the Mosaical and Christian dispensations briefly discussed. -- LETTER VIII. A cursory view of the doctrines contained in the first 18 Articles of the Church of England. -- LETTER IX. The remaining 21 Articles considered -- LETTER X. Our religion, as it influences the heart and conduct. Duties required from us as members of the Church of England, as Christians. Christianity enjoins the same duties as morality, on higher motives and hopes. It is the source of real greatness. -- LETTER XI. The duty of forming virtuous disposition. Its advantage, as preparatory to Heaven. The art of pleasing, a desirable addition to the Christian's character. Duty of a Christian in prosperous periods of the church. Habitual, not affected reverence of God, recommended. The proper degree of candour specified. Christianity a religion of motives. It regulates the heart and temper, and strictly condemns selfishness in all its forms, Consequences of vice. Christianity presupposes a degree of civilization. Recapitulation. -- VOLUME III. : LETTER XII. The sophisms of the depraved part of our species are not the opinion of the world. No person ought to be regardless of the judgment of others. Deference, exertion, and attention to agreeable qualities, strongly enforced. Polished manners, vindicated. Laudable imitations of the great recommended. -- LETTER XIII. General civility essential to politeness, which should be accompanied with candour. It is inconsistent with irritability, negligence, and rudeness. The ease of the true gentleman cannot be copied by coarse imitators. Suitability, characteristic of a good manner. Good humour an essential requisite in our commerce with the world. Deference, distinct from flattery and fervility. Genius and common sense compared. Public amusements should be cautiously enjoyed. -- LETTER XIV. Advantages of a taste for literature. Sentimental reading dangerous, and often ridiculous. Licentious works condemned, and the principles of the new philosophy. The antichristian conspiracy an undoubted fact. Danger of reading periodical criticisms. Impropriety of juvenile compositions. Absurdity of Rousseau's Eloisa, which confounds the nature of vice and virtue. -- LETTER XV. The latitudinarianism of new philosophy considered. Its delights in supposing contradictory duties. We have a right to require from all authors a decorum with respect to religion. Anecdote an unimproving style of reading. Vindication of Alexander the Great from undeserved censure. The general tendency of periodical publications is to excite discontent at inequality of mankind. Reflections on the origin of human improvement, as described by Rousseau; and as detailed in Scripture. -- LETTER XVI. The subject continued. The necessity of industry is a general blessing. Action the natural state of man. The poor of England possess property. Anarchy is productive of misery and injustice: lawful freedom of comfort and security. Common people listen to degrading stories of their superiors with avidity. Dreadful immorality of democrats. Rise and progress of governments as detailed in scripture. Christianity favourable to all lawful authorities. -- LETTER XVII. Democratical notions respecting marriage, education of children, and duty to parents. Human perfectibility. Danger of adopting feeling for a guide, instead of principle. Children capable of religious impressions. Rapid strides of luxury and insubordination.

This is her rare first book. An earlier volume, Miscellaneous Poems, 1780, given to her in CBEL and Todd is, according to Jackson, by her father. Jane West, friend of Sarah Trimmer, was anti-Jacobin and anti radical. Her three novels convey the message that women should stifle their feelings in the interest of duty. The contrast in A Gossip's Story, 1796, between Marianne, ruined by excessive sensibility, and her sensible sister Louisa anticipates the theme of Austen's Sense and Sensibility. Jane West was unsure about whether women of her class should write poetry; in one poem she expresses the fear that it might be an unjustifiable use of time. This compunction she overcomes in her own case as the purposes of the poetry was to inculcate moral virtue. In the ""Advertisement"" she speaks defensively of herself as ""fully engrossed by the essential duties of domestic life"" and ""not...able to consider Poetry in any other light, than as an agreeable relaxation.""",Biography,Includes Dedication and Advertisement.,"Citation : L,O(-err);CtY (?errata), MH-H, NCD, (Unverified); IU in ESTC.

The Female Advocate is described by the writers in Todd as ""an important poem about women of the past."" It also deals with women writers of the present and changing attitudes. It contains a paean to the American slave writer Phillis Wheatley and some highly complimentary lines to Catherine Macaulay. It was possibly the only late 18th century poem by a feminist to follow the earlier mid-century male writers such as George Ballard and John Duncombe, in praising learned and creative women. Mary Scott's list of exemplary women is much longer than Duncombe's, for she seeks to redress the imbalance of historical knowledge about women caused, in her opinion, by male prejudice and female educational deprivation. She calls on women to exercise their talents and on men to welcome women into learning. The thesis of the poem is that, if men can be brought to recognise that women can write as well as men, they must in time admit women to the sciences and to equal education.""
